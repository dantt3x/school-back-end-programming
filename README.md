#### Back-End Programming for University

This project demonstrates the culmination of knowledge of:

- Handling and manipulation of a Relational Database (MySQL entities)
- Unit Testing
- Enumerations
- Lambdas and Streams
- Further Spring framework usage
- Maven compilation

I'm not sure if the MySQL DB is attached to the repository. If it isn't then the project likely will not compile correctly (likely to protect the university's integrity).
